<h3>1. Define Your Objectives and Target Audience</h3>
<p>How you market a commercial property depends mostly on your target audience. So you should start out by defining your main objectives and your target audience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where does your audience spend its time online?</li>
<li>What methods will you use to reach them?</li>
<li>What assets do you need to create?</li>
<li>What is your budget?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your competitors can provide some ideas, so do a short study on what they&#8217;re doing for marketing themselves and their properties,  then think about how you can stand out.</p>
<p>Your value proposition will help set the foundation for your future marketing communications and materials.</p>
<h3>2. Develop a Commercial Real Estate Marketing Plan</h3>
<p>What is a real estate marketing plan (and why do you need one)?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-8277 size-full" src="https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Commercial-real-estate-marketing-strategy-template.jpg" alt="Commercial Real Estate Marketing Plan" width="996" height="481" srcset="https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Commercial-real-estate-marketing-strategy-template.jpg 996w, https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Commercial-real-estate-marketing-strategy-template-300x145.jpg 300w, https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Commercial-real-estate-marketing-strategy-template-768x371.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" /></p>
<p>A marketing plan provides a comprehensive overview of your overall mission, unique selling point, target audience, strategy and metrics you&#8217;ll measure success on.</p>
<p>When creating your plan, make sure you include your:</p>
<ul>
<li>business summary</li>
<li>target market and audience</li>
<li>budget</li>
<li>marketing channels</li>
<li>marketing material</li>
<li>metrics</li>
</ul>
<p>A healthy commercial real estate marketing strategy should have a well-balanced marketing mix and leverage Earned, Paid and Owned media.</p>
<p><strong>Earned Media</strong> &#8211; Includes marketing activities that you typically “earn” by advocates of your brand and include free channels such as SEO, Social Media.</p>
<p><strong>Paid Media</strong> &#8211; Refers to any performance-based channels or paid advertising like cost-per-click, banners, remarketing and paid advertising.</p>
<p><strong>Owned Media</strong> &#8211; Typically includes your own media assets such as your websites, blogs, social media profiles and email marketing lists.</p>
<p>This marketing mix should be distributed across different channels to help mitigate any downside risk in the case things don’t work in a specific marketing area.</p>
<p>With this plan in mind, start mapping out the elements that will be needed to implement your strategy.</p>
<p>Property marketing will depend on the asset type and the target audience, so plan what kind of content will be needed to showcase them. <a href="https://www.sharplaunch.com/blog/marketing-industrial-property/">Marketing industrial property</a> might be different from marketing a multifamily property and the budgets to produce the content for its presentation could range.</p>

<h3>7. Add your Listings on Commercial Real Estate Portals</h3>
<p>Commercial real estate listing services and portals are an effective way to advertise commercial property for lease or sale since they allow you to generate exposure and target a highly relevant audience.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-5745 size-large" src="https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Quantum-listing-1024x551.jpg" alt="Commercial Real Estate Listing Sites" width="1024" height="551" srcset="https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Quantum-listing-1024x551.jpg 1024w, https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Quantum-listing-300x161.jpg 300w, https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Quantum-listing-768x413.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Besides Costar and <a href="https://www.sharplaunch.com/sites/loopnet/">LoopNet</a> there are many other <a href="https://www.sharplaunch.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-commercial-real-estate-listing-sites/">commercial real estate listings</a> sites worth considering to promote your properties and drive leads.</p>
<h3>8. Nurture Your Contacts with Useful Content</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.sharplaunch.com/blog/nurture-commercial-real-estate-leads-content/">Nurturing your contacts with content</a> is one of the key tactics to stay top of mind and nurture your prospects until they are ready to actively engage with your business.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-8617 size-large" src="https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MMG-content-1024x584.jpg" alt="commercial real estate content marketing" width="1024" height="584" srcset="https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MMG-content-1024x584.jpg 1024w, https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MMG-content-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MMG-content-768x438.jpg 768w, https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MMG-content.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>However, not many commercial real estate companies know where to start or what to do.</p>
<p>The key to content marketing is this: don’t just be part of the noise.</p>
<p>Create high-quality content that is useful, relevant or entertaining. This can be done in many different ways including blog posts, market studies, infographics and videos.</p>
<h3>9. Optimize Your Website for SEO</h3>
<p>Make sure you <a href="https://www.sharplaunch.com/blog/real-estate-seo-guide/">develop a real estate SEO plan</a> as early as possible. Visibility from search engines can have a powerful impact for your business and help drive tenants, brokers and investors to your website.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-8368 size-full" src="https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SEO-101-marietta-street.png" alt="commercial real estate SEO" width="700" height="400" srcset="https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SEO-101-marietta-street.png 700w, https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SEO-101-marietta-street-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>However, SEO is a long-term process and requires can take months to start seeing impact.</p>
<h3>10. Share Your Content on Social Media</h3>
<p>Using <a href="https://www.sharplaunch.com/blog/social-media-marketing-for-commercial-real-estate/">social media marketing for commercial real estate</a> is free and an effective way to build brand awareness and drive eyeballs to your website. Savvy commercial real estate professionals are also using social media to spark conversations and facilitate connections with potential customers and partners.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-7101 size-full" src="https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CBRE-linkedin.jpg" alt="social media marketing CBRE" width="556" height="508" srcset="https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CBRE-linkedin.jpg 556w, https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CBRE-linkedin-300x274.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" /></p>
<p>Using <a href="https://www.sharplaunch.com/blog/the-definitive-guide-to-real-estate-marketing-on-linkedin/">LinkedIn for real estate</a>, or even Twitter and Facebook to get more attention for your listings can be a very effective tactic when used properly. The three mentioned social media networks are  most relevant for commercial real estate, and where your company should be most active.</p>
<h3>11. Create a Paid Social Media Advertising Strategy</h3>
<p>Another way to raise awareness and acquire visits is through performance-based <a href="https://www.sharplaunch.com/blog/commercial-real-estate-advertising/">commercial real estate advertising</a> campaigns on LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>These platforms can offer very laser-targeted campaigns, allowing you to select who, when and where your Ads are displayed.</p>
<p>For example, if you are leasing a life science property you could launch a campaign targeting C-level executives in the bioscience industry in a specific geography.</p>
<h3>12. Get Press Coverage</h3>
<p>Building relationships with influencers, journalists and bloggers can pay off big. Outreach takes time but press mentions can help propel your brand awareness and have a massively positive impact on your marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Having your own “black book” of influencers is a key asset and will save you thousands of dollars in PR agency fees who essentially spend most of their efforts around outreach.</p>
<h3>13. Set Up a Google Keyword Campaign</h3>
<p>There are 500 million searches on Google every day and chances are that your clients are searching for keywords related to your commercial property or business right now.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-8079 size-large" src="https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Retail-keywords-expensive-1-1024x928.jpg" alt="google ads keywords" width="1024" height="928" srcset="https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Retail-keywords-expensive-1-1024x928.jpg 1024w, https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Retail-keywords-expensive-1-300x272.jpg 300w, https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Retail-keywords-expensive-1-768x696.jpg 768w, https://www.sharplaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Retail-keywords-expensive-1.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Google Adwords is a very powerful acquisition channel to help you set up commercial real estate ads but <a href="https://www.sharplaunch.com/blog/real-estate-keywords/">real estate keywords can be very expensive</a> depending on your target market. However, what’s great about Adwords is that you can specify your Ad budget to whatever you feel comfortable with and stop at anytime.</p>
<h3>14. Set Up Paid Commercial Real Estate Ads Through Display Campaigns</h3>
<p>Display advertising comes in different formats and can help raise brand awareness and impact thousands (or millions) of people very quickly.</p>
<p>Working with Ad networks like Adwords can help you with advertising your commercial real estate and will provide you with very granular targeting and allow you to decide what websites you want your Ads to appear on.</p>
<h3>15. Target Your Visitors through Remarketing</h3>
<p>Remarketing goes beyond simple display advertising. When a user visits your website, a cookie is dropped on their computer so you can target them and show relevant Ads when they browse on different websites.</p>
<p>This can be an effective way to stay “top of mind” and drive visitors that engaged previously back to your property listing or company website.</p>
<h3>16. Attend Industry Events and Conferences</h3>
<p>It goes without saying, <a href="https://www.sharplaunch.com/blog/top-commercial-real-estate-events-and-conferences/">commercial real estate events</a> are a great opportunity to network, build relationships, generate leads and expand knowledge about the industry and market trends.</p>
<p>The possibility to build many relationships and in-person interactions in such a short period of time is difficult to achieve through other types of marketing channels. However, it&#8217;s critical to have a well-defined event marketing strategy because attendance and participation usually comes with a hefty cost.</p>
<h3>17. Advertise on Trade Journals</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.sharplaunch.com/blog/the-essential-list-of-commercial-real-estate-trade-journals/">Commercial real estate trade journals</a> and online publications are read daily by thousands of potential investors, brokers and other industry peers.</p>
<p>Almost all industry journals offer advertising opportunities to help with advertising commercial real estate in front of a large, national audience or a more focused regional segment.</p>
<h3>18. Measure Your Success</h3>
<p>Always, always remember this basic adage:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you can’t measure it, don’t mess with it&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The most critical component of a success commercial real estate marketing strategy is measuring the success of your activities. Define key metrics for each of your marketing channels, setup a <a href="https://www.sharplaunch.com/blog/how-to-create-a-real-estate-marketing-report/">real estate marketing report</a>, and make data-driven decisions to continuously improve your efforts.</p>
<p>Don’t let your strategy get stale. You should constantly be testing ideas and tactics to see what works and, more importantly, what doesn’t have any impact.</p>
<p>Most importantly, don&#8217;t lose sight of how your marketing strategies impact your business objectives. If you can&#8217;t quantify the direct or indirect impact on your lease-up, sales or tenant retention efforts (or whatever else) then you need to go back to the drawing board.</p>
<h2>Marketing Strategy Template (Bonus)</h2>
<p>If you want to create an effective commercial real estate marketing plan, you need a systematic approach and a set of <a href="https://www.sharplaunch.com/blog/tools-commercial-real-estate-marketers-should-know/">commercial real estate marketing tools</a> that will help define the objectives and key metrics and implement the overall campaign.</p>
<p>The following real estate marketing plan template is an Excel spreadsheet that will help you organize all of this.</p>
